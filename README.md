# CircleCI Usage Report Visualizer

A **zero-dependency, single-file HTML dashboard** for analyzing CircleCI usage data exported via the CircleCI Usage Export API. Drop in your CSV and instantly get interactive charts, credit burn analysis, resource utilization insights, and downloadable rightsizing reports — all running locally in your browser with no data ever leaving your machine.

---

## 📥 Download & Run `get-usage.sh`

**[⬇️ Download get-usage.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmariRules/circleci-usage-visualizer/main/get-usage.sh)**

> Right-click the link above and choose **Save Link As** to download the file.

This script handles everything: it authenticates with CircleCI, pulls your usage data, decompresses it, merges it, and saves it as a clean CSV named with your org and date range — ready to drop straight into the visualizer.

---

### Running the script

**Step 1 — Open Terminal**

On your Mac, press `⌘ + Space`, type **Terminal**, and press Enter.

**Step 2 — Navigate to your Downloads folder**

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

**Step 3 — Make the script executable**

```bash
chmod +x get-usage.sh
```

> You only need to do this once. After this step you can also **double-click** the file in Finder to run it — no Terminal needed.

**Step 4 — Run it**

```bash
./get-usage.sh
```

The script will walk you through the rest — entering your API key, choosing an org and date range, and saving the output file.

### What happens when you run it

```
✓ Using saved API key from Keychain

Enter Organization ID:
Org ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Select Date Range:
  [1] Default: Last 30 days
  [2] Custom date range

→ Creating export job...
→ Waiting for data to be prepared...
✓ Data ready! (took 0m 28s)
→ Downloading and merging files...
✓ Saved: orgname-usage_2025-12-01_to_2025-12-31.csv
```

Your file is named automatically — no renaming needed. See [`docs/get-usage-guide.md`](docs/get-usage-guide.md) for the complete walkthrough.

## 🗂 Org ID History

The script automatically remembers every organization you pull data from. After each successful export, it writes the org's name, ID, and the date it was last used to a plain-text JSON file at:

```
~/.circleci-usage-orgs.json
```

The next time you run the script, instead of typing an org ID you'll see a numbered menu of recent orgs sorted by most recently used:

```
Recent Organizations:

  [1] my-org                  xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  (last used: 2026-03-01)
  [2] another-org             yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy  (last used: 2026-02-15)

  [N] Enter a new Org ID

Select option:
```

Pressing a number loads that org instantly. Pressing `N` lets you type a new one, which then gets added to the list automatically. If you manage multiple orgs, this removes all the copy-paste overhead between runs.

The file is stored in your home directory (not inside the repo) so there's no risk of accidentally committing customer org IDs to GitHub. Org IDs are not credentials — they're just identifiers — so a plain JSON file is appropriate here. You can open and edit it manually at any time.

## 🔑 API Key Management

Your CircleCI API key is stored securely in macOS Keychain — never written to disk as plaintext.

**If your key is expired, wrong, or you get a login error**, reset it with one command:

```bash
security delete-generic-password -s "circleci-usage-script" -a "api-key"
```

Then re-run `./get-usage.sh` — it will prompt you for a fresh key and save it.

**To create a new API key:**
1. Go to [https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens)
2. Click **Create New Token**, give it a name, and copy it
3. It starts with `CCIPAT_`

**Error signs that mean you need a new key:**
- Script returns `HTTP 401` — key is invalid or expired
- Script returns `HTTP 403` — key doesn't have access to that org
- Warning about unexpected key format — key may have been copied incorrectly

## 🚀 Quick Start — Visualizer

### Option 1 — Local server (recommended)

```bash
# Run from the directory containing index.html and your CSV
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8765`

> A local server is recommended because some browsers block reading local files directly. It also enables the `?autoload` feature.

### Option 2 — GitHub Pages

This visualizer is hosted publicly at:
**[https://amarirules.github.io/circleci-usage-visualizer/](https://amarirules.github.io/circleci-usage-visualizer/)**

Upload your CSV using the file picker. No data is sent to any server — everything runs in your browser.

---

## 🔧 Auto-load Feature

When running with a local server, skip the file picker by passing your filename as a URL parameter:

```
http://localhost:8765/?autoload=orgname-usage_2025-12-01_to_2025-12-31.csv
```

The CSV must be in the same directory as `index.html`.

## 📤 Export Naming Convention

Downloaded reports are automatically named to match the source file:

| Source file | Exported report |
|---|---|
| `orgname-usage_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` | `orgname-usage_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD-circleci-underutilized-jobs.csv` |
| `orgname-usage_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` | `orgname-usage_YYYY-MM-DD_to_YYYY-MM-DD-circleci-overprovisioned-jobs.csv` |

---

## 📊 CSV Format

**Required columns:**
`PROJECT_NAME` · `JOB_NAME` · `WORKFLOW_NAME` · `RESOURCE_CLASS` · `JOB_BUILD_STATUS` · `JOB_RUN_SECONDS` · `TOTAL_CREDITS` · `JOB_RUN_DATE` · `PIPELINE_CREATED_AT` · `VCS_BRANCH`

**Optional (enables Resource Utilization section):**
